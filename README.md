## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DUPLICATE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`: (Default: 0.5) Controls duplicate detection sensitivity:

  - Recommended range: 0.4 - 0.7

### Channel Types

The app recognizes different channel types and adjusts analysis accordingly:
- **Expense channels**: Focus on software tools, costs, and ROI
- **Technical channels**: Focus on bugs, features, and improvements
